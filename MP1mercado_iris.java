in making predictions. Through the process, I saw how the model could learn patterns from the training data, but I also realized that challenges can easily affect its accuracy. For example, overfitting might make the model perform well on training data but poorly on new data. I also thought about how messy or incomplete data could confuse the model, which is something very common in real-life situations. This made me understand that building a reliable ML model is not just about training—it’s also about making sure the data is clean and the model is balanced."],"metadata":{"id":"ijV0lnbrxKqF"}}]}
